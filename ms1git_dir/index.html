                <p>Ancient hairdressing
                Hairdressing as an occupation dates back thousands of years. Ancient art drawings and paintings have been 
                discovered depicting people working on another person's hair. Greek writers <i>Aristophanes and Homer</i> both mention 
                hairdressing in their writings. </p>

                <p>In Africa, it was believed in some cultures that a person's spirit occupied his 
                or her hair, giving hairdressers high status within these communities. The status of hairdressing encouraged many 
                to develop their skills, and close relationships were built between hairdressers and their clients. Hours would be 
                spent washing, combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair. Men would work specifically on men, and women on 
                other women. Before a master hairdresser died, they would give their combs and tools to a chosen successor during a 
                special ceremony.</p>

                <p> In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including 
                lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal 
                barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as 
                hairdressers.</p>

                <p>In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including 
                dyeing and shaving. Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. 
                Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists 
                from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a papal decree in 1092 demanded that 
                all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.

                <h3>17th-Century</h3>
                <p><img src="../ma02htmlcss/images/The Laced Angel_ Romantic Redux.jpg" alt="The laced Angel image" class="align-right medium"/>
                <p>In Europe the first appearance of the word "hairdresser" is in 17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a 
                profession. Hair fashion of the period suggested that wealthy women wear large, complex and heavily adorned hairstyles, 
                which would be maintained by their personal maids and other people, who would spend hours dressing the woman's hair. 
                A wealthy man's hair would often be maintained by a valet. It was in France where men began styling women's hair for the 
                first time, and many of the notable hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would continue into contemporary times. 
                The first famous male hairdresser was <i>Champagne</i>, who was born in Southern France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his 
                own hair salon and dressed the hair of wealthy Parisian women until his death in 1658.<p/>
                
                <p>Women's hair grew taller in style during the 17th century, popularized by the hairdresser<b><i>Madame Martin</i></b>.
                The hairstyle,<i>"the tower,"</i> was the trend with wealthy English and American women, who relied on hairdressers to style 
                their hair as tall as possible. Tall piles of curls were pomaded, powdered and decorated with ribbons, flowers, lace, 
                feathers and jewelry.

                <blockquote><q><b><i>The profession of hairdressing was launched as a genuine profession when Legros de Rumigny
                was declared the first official hairdresser of the French court.</blockquote></q></b></i>

                <p>In 1765 de <b><i>Rumigny</i></b> published his book Art <q><i>de la Coiffure des Dames</i></q>, which 
                discussed hairdressing and included pictures of hairstyles designed by him. The book was a best seller amongst 
                Frenchwomen, and four years later de Rumigny opened a school for hairdressers: <b>Academie de Coiffure</b>. 
                At the school he taught men and women to cut hair and create his special hair designs.</p>

                <p>By 1777, approximately 1,200 hairdressers were working in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and 
                demanded that hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their trade, 
                and hairdressers responded that their roles were not the same, hairdressing was a service, and wigmakers made and sold a 
                product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically three Frenchmen:<i>Frederic, 
                Larseueur, and Léonard.Leonard and Larseueur</i> were the stylists for <i>Marie Antoinette.</i> <i>Leonard</i> was her
                favorite, and developed many hairstyles that became <i>fashion trends within wealthy Parisian circles, including the 
                loge d'opera, which towered five feet over the wearer's head. During the French Revolution</i>. He escaped the 
                country hours before he was to be arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other clients. He emigrated to Russia, where he
                worked as the premier hairdresser for Russian nobility.</p>

                <img src="../ma02htmlcss/images/1920S Hair.jpg" alt="19 th century hair picture" class="align-left medium"/>
                <p>Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential styles during the early 19th century. Wealthy French women 
                would have their favorite hairdressers style their hair from within their own homes, a trend seen in wealthy 
                international communities. Hairdressing was primarily a service affordable only to those wealthy enough to hire 
                professionals or to pay for servants to care for their hair.</p>

                <p>In the United States, <i>Marie Laveau</i> was one of the most famous hairdressers of the period. <i>Laveau</i>, 
                located in New Orleans, began working as a hairdresser in the early 1820s, maintaining the hair of wealthy women of 
                the city. She was a voodoo practitioner, called the <q><i>Voodoo Queen of New Orleans</q></i>, and she used her 
                connections to wealthy women to support her religious practice. She provided <q><i>help</i></q> to women who needed 
                it for money, gifts and other favors.

                <p>French hairdresser <i>Marcel Grateau</i> developed the <q><i>Marcel wave</i></q> in the late part of the century. 
                His wave required the use of a special hot hair iron and needed to be done by an experienced hairdresser. 
                Fashionable women asked to have their hair <q><i>marceled</i></q>. During this period, hairdressers began 
                opening salons in cities and towns, led by <i>Martha Matilda Harper</i>, who developed one of the first retail 
                chains of hair salons, the Harper Method.Beauty salons became popularized during the 20th century, alongside 
                men's barbershops. These spaces served as social spaces, allowing women to socialize while having their hair 
                done and other services such as facials. Wealthy women still had hairdressers visit their home, but, the 
                majority of women visited salons for services, including high-end salons such as <i>Elizabeth Arden's 
                Red Door Salon</i>.</p>

                <p>Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place during this period. Electricity led to the development of 
                permanent wave machines and hair dryers. These tools allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons, over 
                limited service in-home visits. New coloring processes were developed, including those by <i>Eugene Schueller</i> 
                in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to perform complicated styling techniques. After World War I, the bob cut and the 
                shingle bob became popular, alongside other short haircuts. In the 1930s complicated styles came back into fashion, 
                alongside the return of the <q>Marcel wave</q>. <blockquote><i>Hairdressing was one of the few acceptable professions 
                during this time for women, alongside teaching, nursing and clerical work.</i></blockquote>

                <p>Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations, at 20%. 
                A state license is required for hairdressers to practice, with qualifications varying from state to state. 
                Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have a high school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of 
                age, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or cosmetology school. Full-time programs often last 
                9 months or more, leading to an associate degree. After students graduate from a program, they take a state 
                licensing exam, which often consists of a written test, and a practical test of styling or an oral exam. 
                Hairdressers must pay for licenses, and occasionally licenses must be renewed. Some states allow hairdressers to 
                work without obtaining a new license, while others require a new license. About 44% of hairdressers are self-employed, 
                often putting in 40-hour work weeks, and even longer among the self-employed. In 2008, 29% of hairstylists worked part-time, 
                and 14% had variable schedules. As of 2008, people working as hairdressers totaled about 630,700, with a projected increase 
                to 757,700 by 2018..</p>

                <p>Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place during this period. Electricity led to the development of 
                  permanent wave machines and hair dryers. These tools allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons, 
                  over limited service in-home visits. New coloring processes were developed, including those by Eugene Schueller in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to perform complicated styling techniques. After World War I, the bob cut and the shingle bob became popular, alongside other short haircuts. </p>
