                <p>In Europe the first appearance of the word "hairdresser" is in 17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a 
                    profession. It was in France where men began styling women's hair for the 
                    first time, and many of the notable hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would continue into contemporary times. 
                    The first famous male hairdresser was, who was born in Southern France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his 
                    own hair salon and dressed the hair of wealthy Parisian women until his death in 1658.

                            was declared the first official hairdresser of the French court.</blockquote>

                        <p>Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential styles during the early 19th century. Wealthy French women 
                            would have their favorite hairdressers style their hair from within their own homes, a trend seen in wealthy 
                            international communities. Hairdressing was primarily a service affordable only to those wealthy enough to hire 
                            professionals or to pay for servants to care for their hair.

                        <p>Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations, at 20%. 
                            A state license is required for hairdressers to practice, with qualifications varying from state to state. 
                            Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have a high school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of
